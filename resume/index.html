<ul>
<li>I like to think about software architecture and algorithms, fine-grained performance optimizations, and everything in&nbsp;between.</li>
<li>I enjoy learning new languages and systems, and I’m flexible about different
approaches to writing code and building&nbsp;software.</li>
<li>I work and play well with&nbsp;others.</li>

Rejecting the notion of a teacher-proof textbook that legalistically lays out the steps of a technique and all its potential edge cases and variations, we chose instead to create a text whose purpose was to generate rich and messy mathematical conversations.  So there are no explanations, no worked out examples, no reference material&mdash;all of that is the work of the students and teacher together in the&nbsp;classroom.</p>
